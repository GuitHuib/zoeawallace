      Zoë A. Wallace (formerly known as Zoë Holbrook) is a classical composer
      and guitarist who is continually striving to broaden the repertoire for
      instruments in an ensemble setting. She has performed in a number of
      concerts as a soloist and in a duo throughout California, Illinois, and
      Utah, and has had the pleasure of playing the premieres of such pieces as
      Duet in A Major by Darlene Castro, Roots by Nicholas Denton-Protsack,
      Vertex by Zoë Wallace, the west coast premiere of Distance and the Sea by
      Stan Funicelli, and many others. Most recently, Zoë founded Nightingale
      Ensemble and acts as the guitarist, resident composer, and artistic
      director to continue her goal of expanding the repertoire for unusual
      instrument pairings.
